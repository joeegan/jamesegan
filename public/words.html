    Massimo Liberale, 18, from Catania, Sicily, is a qualified piano tuner who 
    dreams of moving to England and becoming one of the 21st century's 
    major poets. His poetry writing is a fiercely private matter which he 
    tells no one about. As mother is dead and father's vanished, he doesn't  
    hesitate at the thought of embarking on this anglo-literary odyssey.
