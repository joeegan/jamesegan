    Massimo Liberale, 18, from Catania, Sicily, is a qualified piano tuner who 
    dreams of moving to England and becoming one of the 21st century's 
    major poets. His poetry writing is a fiercely private matter which he 
    tells no one about. As mother is dead and father's vanished, he doesn't  
    hesitate at the thought of embarking on this anglo-literary odyssey. 
 </p> 
 <p> 
    Whilst our protagonist crosses the sea at night, he makes a vow. 
    He will keep a poetic diary, every day for a year, and if one 
    of his entries isn't published within a year, he'll perform an act of depraved abandon. 
          </p> 
 <p> 
    Mr Liberale seeks out affordable lodgings in a close-knit neighbourhood.  
    Residents are quick to accept Massimo as their new piano tuner and he picks  
    up work almost immediately. Whilst working on the Messina family piano, Massimo  
    is introduced to daughter Federica and a relationship is quickly underway.

30    What with Massimo's vivacious nature and master craftsmanship, his 
31    customer base is quickly blossoming. Churches, schools and residents 
32    are all queuing up to have their pianos tuned (many for the first time 
33    in years) and Federica is pregnant with twins. 
34 </p> 
35 <p> 
36    The year is up before Massimo's made a single literary inquiry. He travels 
37    to Morecambe bay and drowns himself with a few cans of Guinness and 
38    rucksack full of sand. A heavily pregnant Federica reports him missing.

41    At the graveyard, Federica goes into labour as they're lowering the coffin. 
42    At the house, two police officers rifle through her room while she gives birth to twins. A little green book is found hiding under a loose floor board.  
43    It is the poetic diary of Massimo Liberale. 
44 </p> 
45 <p> 
46    The drama centres around these poetic diary entries. They deal with themes of  
47    isolation, finding solace in times of adversity and dreary weather.
