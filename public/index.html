   Massimo Liberale, 18, from Catania, Sicily, is a qualified piano tuner who
   dreams of moving to England and becoming one of the 21st century's
   major poets. His poetry writing is a fiercely private matter which he
   tells no one about. As mother is dead and father's vanished, he doesn't hesitate at the thought of embarking on this anglo-literary odyssey.
</p>
<p>
   Whilst our protagonist crosses the sea at night, he makes a vow.
   He will keep a poetic diary, every day for a year, and if one
   of his entries isn't published within a year, he'll perform an act of depraved abandon.
</p>
<p>
   Mr Liberale seeks out affordable lodgings in a close-knit neighbourhood. 
   Residents are quick to accept Massimo as their new piano tuner and he picks 
   up work almost immediately. Whilst working on the Messina family piano, Massimo 
   is introduced to daughter Federica and a relationship swiftly ensues.
</p>
<p>
   What with Massimo's vivacious nature and master craftsmanship, his
   customer base is quickly blossoming. Churches, schools and residents
   are all queuing up to have their pianos tuned (many for the first time
   in years) and Federica is pregnant with twins.
</p>
<p>
   The year is up before Massimo's made a single literary inquiry. He travels
   to Morecambe bay and drowns himself with a few cans of Guinness and
   rucksack full of sand. A heavily pregnant Federica reports him missing.
</p>
<p>
   At the graveyard, Federica goes into labour as they're lowering his coffin.
   At the house, two police officers comb through her room while she's delivering the twins. 
   A little green book is found hidden under a loose floorboard. 
   It is the poetic diary of Massimo Liberale.
</p>
<p>
   The drama centres around these poetic diary entries. They deal with themes of 
   isolation, finding solace in times of adversity and dreary weather.
