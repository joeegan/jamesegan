<p>
   Massimo Liberale, 18, from Catania, Sicily, is a qualified piano tuner who
   dreams of moving to England and becoming one of the 21st century's
   major poets. His poetry writing is a fiercely private matter which he
   tells no one about. As his mother is dead and father's left, he doesn't
   hesitate at the idea of embarking on this anglo-literary adventure.
</p>
<p>
   As our protagonist is sailing across the sea at night, he makes a vow.
   He will keep a poetic diary, every day for a year, and if at least one
   of his entries isn't published within a year, he will take his own
   life!
</p>
<p>
   Mr Liberale seeks out a cheap area in Greater Manchester and finds
   himself in a close-knit community.
   Residents are quick to accept their new piano tuner and he gets work
   and accommodation almost immediately. Through his neighbour who needs a piano tuned, Massimo meets their daughter
   Federica and a relationship is quickly underway.
</p>
<p>
   What with Massimo's vivacious nature and master craftsmanship, his
   customer base is quickly blossoming. Churches, schools and residents
   are all queuing up to have their pianos tuned (many for the first time
   in years) and Federica is pregnant with twins.
</p>
<p>
   The year is up before he's made a single literary inquiry. He travels
   to Morecambe bay and drowns himself with a few cans of Guinness and
   rucksack full of sand. Federica reports him missing.
</p>
<p>
   A week after his burial, Federica gives birth to twins. A year later,
   at the house, their room is being cleared out. A little green book is
   found hiding under a loose floor board. It is the poetic diary of
   Massimo Liberale.
</p>
<p>
   The drama / story centres around these poetic diary entries. They deal
   with themes of isolation, finding solace in times of adversity and
   dreary weather.
